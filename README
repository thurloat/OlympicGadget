Notes:
    - to compile new version, zip contents of gadget directory and rename the zip file to OlympicMedalsGadget.gadget (so user is prompted to update rather than install a second version).
    - when updating, increase the version number in both the JAVA source code and the gadget.xml file
    - that is all.
